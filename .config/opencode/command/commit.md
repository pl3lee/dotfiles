# Commit Changes

You are tasked with creating git commits for the changes made during this session.

## Process:

1. **Think about what changed:**
   - Review the conversation history and understand what was accomplished
   - Review the `git status -s` to get an idea of what files changed
   - Consider whether changes should be one commit or multiple logical commits
   - Use `git diff` on specific files if you need more context. Only do this if you have no knowledge of the changes in that file.

2. **Plan your commit(s):**
   - Identify which files belong together
   - Draft clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Use imperative mood in commit messages
   - Focus on why the changes were made, not just what

3. **Present your plan to the user:**
   - List the files you plan to add for each commit
   - Show the commit message(s) you'll use
   - Ask: "I plan to create [N] commit(s) with these changes. Shall I proceed?"

4. **Execute upon confirmation:**
   - Use `git add` with specific files (never use `-A` or `.`)
   - Create commits with your planned messages
   - Show the result with `git log --oneline -n [N]`

## Remember:
- You have the full context of what was done in this session
- Group related changes together
- Keep commits focused and atomic when possible
- The user trusts your judgment - they asked you to commit
